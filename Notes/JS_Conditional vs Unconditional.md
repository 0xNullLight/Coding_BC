### Conditional vs. Unconditional Functions in JavaScript

In JavaScript, functions can be categorized based on their execution behavior into **conditional** and **unconditional** functions. Here’s a detailed explanation of each type:

---

### Conditional Functions

**Conditional functions** make decisions based on specific conditions. They use conditional statements to execute different blocks of code depending on the input values or other runtime conditions.

**Key Features:**
- **Decision Making:** They use constructs like `if`, `else`, `switch`, or ternary operators to choose different execution paths.
- **Behavior Variation:** The behavior of these functions can vary based on the provided input or state.

**Example:**

```javascript
function checkAge(age) {
    if (age >= 18) {
        console.log('You are an adult.');
    } else {
        console.log('You are a minor.');
    }
}

checkAge(20); // Outputs: You are an adult.
checkAge(15); // Outputs: You are a minor.
```

In this example, the `checkAge` function includes an `if-else` statement to determine whether the age provided indicates an adult or a minor. The function’s output changes based on the age value passed to it, demonstrating its conditional nature.

**When to Use:**
- **Varied Outputs:** When the function needs to handle multiple scenarios differently.
- **Dynamic Behavior:** When decisions must be made at runtime based on inputs or external conditions.

### Unconditional Functions

**Unconditional functions** are designed to perform a specific task every time they are called, without considering any conditions. They execute the same block of code regardless of the inputs or state.

**Key Features:**
- **Fixed Execution Path:** They execute a predetermined set of instructions every time they run.
- **Predictable Outcome:** The result of the function does not change based on the inputs.

**Example:**

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('Alice'); // Always outputs: Hello, Alice!
```

In this example, the `greet` function always prints a greeting message with the provided name, demonstrating its unconditional behavior. The function's action remains constant regardless of the input.

**When to Use:**
- **Consistent Action:** When the function needs to perform the same operation each time.
- **Simplicity:** When the functionality does not require decision-making or varied behavior.

### Summary of Differences

- **Execution Logic:** Conditional functions have logic that changes based on conditions, whereas unconditional functions execute the same code regardless of conditions.
- **Application:** Use conditional functions for scenarios requiring different outcomes based on inputs. Use unconditional functions for tasks where the action remains consistent every time.

Understanding the distinction between these types of functions helps in writing clearer, more effective code, ensuring that functions behave as intended under various circumstances.
