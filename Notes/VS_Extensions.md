**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** is a highly popular, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It is known for its speed, flexibility, and rich ecosystem of extensions that enhance its functionality. VS Code supports a wide range of programming languages and provides various features such as debugging, integrated Git control, syntax highlighting, and code completion. Its extensibility allows developers to customize and extend the editor to fit their specific needs.

Here’s a rundown of some useful extensions for VS Code I found on my journey thus far:
